Farmer,2,Pilot the re-commercialisation of an abandoned mine���,"Queensland has approximately 120 complex abandoned mine sites. Several sites have re-commercialisation potential due to their tailings storages, stockpiles or remaining in-ground resources. This is a growing area of interest, as investors are increasingly considering mining within a circular economy, and technology used to recover minerals in these sites is improving constantly. The government will conduct a pilot program to release a high-priority abandoned mine site with re-commercialisation potential through market sounding, followed by a competitive tender process. Learnings from this pilot will help inform future releases.",1: Grow and diversify the industry,2022,,30/09/2022,Department of Resources,BANANA SHIRE,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text

Ecologist,39,"Implement reforms for objections, review and notification processes for project approvals�","There are inconsistencies in approaches to objection and review mechanisms for administrative decisions across the Resource Acts.37 These can cause delays and create inequities for stakeholders. The government intends to refer to the Queensland Law Reform Commission a review of the objections processes for mining leases under the Mineral Resources Act 1989, including the role of the Land Court in this process, and whether a consistent process should be applied to petroleum leases. The review will also include the associated review processes with environmental authorities under the Environmental Protection Act 1994. The terms of reference for the review will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders. Timing for the review will be confirmed in the final plan. While the Commission undertakes this work, the government will investigate opportunities to harmonise broader review mechanisms for other decisions across the Resources Acts to provide more transparency, consistency and equity for stakeholders. We will also investigate targeted legislative amendments to streamline public notification processes. All reforms will maintain environmental protections and the opportunity for the community to participate.",6: Improve Regulatory Efficiency,2022-2024,Not yet commenced,N/A,Department of Resources,,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text
Ecologist,40,Implement reforms for small-scale mining�,"The state?s return from the regulatory and administrative effort it expends on regulating small scale mining is limited due to small production amounts which provide limited economic returns to the state. Additionally, a recent cost-benefit analysis found that the sector had only a marginal benefit on the Queensland economy and surrounding communities.38 As a result, the Queensland Government proposes to remove mining claims from the Mineral Resources Act 1989. It will implement an immediate moratorium on accepting new mining claim applications while consultation on this proposal occurs through this draft. The government will announce its decision about progressing this reform in the final plan. It will also consult with stakeholders to develop transitional arrangements to grandfather existing tenement holders. In working through these transition arrangements, requirements under the Environmental Protection Act 1994 will be considered and streamlined. Importantly, small-scale miners will still be able to gain tenure through a mining lease, and recreational miners will still get access to designated fossicking areas in the state.",6: Improve Regulatory Efficiency,2021-2023,Commenced,31/12/2023 (TBC),Department of Resources,,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text
Ecologist,41,Implement reforms for use of steel casing�,The Petroleum and Gas (Safety) Regulation 2018 and Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulation 2017 prohibit the use of steel casing in horizontal wells unless the operator receives an exemption from RSHQ. The Queensland Government will remove the prohibition on the use of steel casing in horizontal coal seam gas wells where there is no overlapping tenure. The well?s exact location and type will be reported and made publicly available through the Department of Resources? Open Data Portal. The government will also consult with stakeholders about the merits of additional regulatory reform. One option could be to allow steel casing in horizontal wells if the relevant tenure holders have included the use of steel casing in their joint interaction management plans and/or joint development plans.,6: Improve Regulatory Efficiency,2022-2023,Phase 1: Nov 2021 Non Overlapping  Tenures (Already started:,TBC,Department of Resources,,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text
Ecologist,42,Develop a fit-for-purpose framework for extractive industry assessment�,"Key resource areas (KRAs) are areas of land where the Minister for Resources identifies extractive resources of state or regional significance, such as sand and aggregates, which are needed to support the construction and infrastructure sectors. The State Planning Policy states that, when KRAs are identified, the relevant local government must protect the extractive resource through provisions in its planning scheme. The Queensland Government will consult with stakeholders, including local governments, the community and extractive industry operators, to develop a fit-for-purpose extractive industry assessment framework. This framework will balance the impacts of extractive industries with local and state need for construction materials to support infrastructure priorities.",6: Improve Regulatory Efficiency,2022-2023,,30/09/2022,Department of Resources,,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text
Ecologist,43,Improve cost recovery for government services provided to industry and ensure tenures are actively developed�,"The package of process and regulatory reforms discussed in this section will improve the efficiency of the services and functions that the government provides to the resources industry. However, the Department of Resources recovers only around 15 per cent of the total cost of administering the regulatory framework that applies to the resources industry. The fees and charges that industry pays should better reflect the costs of the services being provided, in line with the government?s Principles for Fees and Charges. The Queensland Government will develop a regulatory impact statement to consult with stakeholders on ways to more fully recover the department?s administrative costs. As part of this work, the Queensland Government will also undertake a review of rent to ensure that rent charged to resource authority holders is appropriate and that it encourages active exploration and development.",6: Improve Regulatory Efficiency,2022-2023,Phase 2: TBC,15/12/2023,Department of Resources,,,https://images.pexels.com/photos/2892618/pexels-photo-2892618.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750,Image Alt Text
